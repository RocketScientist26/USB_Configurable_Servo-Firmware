Image "Servo Firmware - SWV statistical profiling - no USB.png" shows 
profiling results while PID is running but without USB app polling status 
continuously. Image "Servo Firmware - SWV statistical profiling - with  
USB.png" shows same but with app polling status continuously (PID also 
running).

As you can see most of the time MCU runs functions in "App_Loop()" (like 
"LED_Update()", "USB_Det()", etc..), which can be interrupted even much more 
frequently with PID timer interrupt. So there is plenty of MCU time for 
running PID at even higher frequencies or for any other tasks, I just did
not considered higher PID frequency to be necessary so limited it to 200hz.
